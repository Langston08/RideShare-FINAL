This program simulates a system where vehicles pick up and drop off passengers. It generates a set number of vehicles and passengers, assigns them to random stations, and simulates the process of matching passengers with available vehicles. Each vehicle can hold up to three passengers at a time. The goal is to transport passengers to their randomly assigned destinations.

Additionally, I manually calculated the average percentage of passengers who successfully reached their destinations. When there were 40 cars and 20 passengers, the success rate averaged 35.5%. With 50 cars and 20 passengers, the average dropped to 25.2%.
