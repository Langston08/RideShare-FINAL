This program models a system where vehicles pick up and drop off passengers. It generates a set number of vehicles and passengers, assigns them to random stations, and simulates the process of matching passengers with available vehicles. Each vehicle can hold up to three passengers at a time. The goal is to transport passengers to their randomly assigned destinations.

Additionally, I manually calculated the average percentage of passengers who successfully reached their destinations. When there were 40 cars and 20 passengers, the success rate averaged 35.5%. With 50 cars and 20 passengers, the average dropped to 25.2%.

PROUD: I'm really proud of my Road file because it took me a long time to figure out. Every time I called another file, I had to keep updating the entire program, which led to a lot of mistakes. I spent hours debugging, and on Wednesday from 5 to 10 PM, I worked with Evan Chen to get it running. After countless adjustments, the errors finally stopped, and the program worked as expected.

I'm also really proud of my Tester. Initially, I designed it to run four simulations: two with 50 passengers and two with 40. However, I realized that my stations kept exceeding 60 because Java wasn’t recognizing that I wanted to reuse the existing stations instead of creating new ones each time. After struggling with this issue, I decided to leave a comment instructing users to manually adjust the passenger count as needed. This simple change made everything so much easier to manage.


CHALLENGES: Car and Road were by far the most challenging files in this project. I was beyond frustrated with the constant errors and endless fixes. Since I struggled on the array test, I had to relearn key concepts and have my friends explain what could be done with arrays so I could apply them correctly. I kid you not, Evan Chen and I spent over 10 hours this week troubleshooting everything. We met during L periods, lunch, and even FaceTimed after school just to get things working.

A lot of my code is heavily influenced by his because, as he walked me through why my original approach wasn’t working, he referenced his own RideShare project and explained what had worked well for him. His insights helped me adjust my code to finally get it running properly. Throughout the project, I made sure to thank Evan in my code comments because, without his willingness to work around my schedule and help me troubleshoot on weekends, I would have struggled to get past some of the major roadblocks this project threw at me.

That being said, relying on his guidance also came with its own challenges. I wanted to make sure I truly understood the parts I was struggling with rather than just following instructions. To reinforce my understanding, I left detailed comments in every file, explaining each line of code in my own words. This practice made it clear to me that I knew what was happening in my program. By the end of the project, I was able to write the code without any outside guidance, which was a huge accomplishment.
