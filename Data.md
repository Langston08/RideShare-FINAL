TO ANSWER THE QUESTION: If there are 50 passengers, what percentage of them make it to their destination if there 20 cars? What percentage of passengers make it if there are 40 cars?

After running the program 5 separate times, I found that for 50 passengers and 20 cars the average of those passengers making it ot their destination was 25.2%
The data was:
14/50, 5/50, 16/50, 16/50, 12/50 SO TOTAL AVERAGE → 12.6/50

After running the program 5 separate times, I found that for 40 passengers and 20 cars the average of those passengers making it ot their destination was 35.5%
The data was:
17/40, 11/40, 13/40, 16/40, 14/40 SO TOTAL AVERAGE → 14.2/40
